PESummary: The Parameter Estimation Summarypage generator

The aim of `PESummary` is to produce summarypages for results files generated from all sample generated codes. It is primarily designed to be used with the results files from GW specific codes, but can be used for more general packages. For installation instructions see https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/pesummary/installation.html.
