=====================================

PESummary: The code agnostic Parameter Estimation Summary page builder
----------------------------------------------------------------------

PESummary is a collaboration-driven Python package providing tools for
generating summary pages for all sample generating codes. 

PESummary provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common
LIGO/Virgo samples and allows for the user to reproduce all outputs from the
LIGO/Virgo Scientific collaboration.
