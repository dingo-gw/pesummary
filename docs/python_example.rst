You are able to run :code:`PESummary` from within an iPython shell. Below are instructions on how this is done with examples of what the summarypages might look like.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/run_with_python.py            
   :language: python                                                            
   :linenos:

Running the script above will generate summarypages in the `./outdir` directory.
