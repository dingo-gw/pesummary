==============

The `summarycombine` executable combines multiple result files from multiple
analyses into a single PESummary metafile. As with the `summarypages` executable
you are able to pass configuration files, injections files, psds and calibration
envelopes and all this information will also be stored in the metafile.

To see help for this executable please run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ summarycombine --help

.. program-output:: summarycombine --help
