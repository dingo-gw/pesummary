========================
Reading in a result file
========================

PESummary provides 2 different modules, a `core` module and a `gw` specific
module. The `gw` module builds upon the `core` module to provide extra
functionality to solve the `gw` problem. Therefore, there are 2 different
functions to read in a result file. One using the `core` package, and one using
the `gw` package:

core read
---------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Reading a result file <core/read>
    Reading a pesummary result file <core/read_pesummary>

gw read
-------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Reading a result file <gw/read>
    Reading a pesummary result file <gw/read_pesummary>
