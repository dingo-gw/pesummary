Passing Custom plots
====================

One of the best features of PESummary is that you are able to pass a python
script containing custom plotting functions which will not only be executed
for all result files, but will also will be added directly to the webpages
ready for you to inspect and share with your collaborators. An example python

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/custom_plot.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
